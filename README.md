# Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is built by experienced developers to take care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Django is free and open source, with a thriving community and great documentation.

Key features of Django:
- Fast: Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
- Secure: Django helps developers avoid many common security mistakes by providing a secure way to manage user authentication and permissions.
- Scalable: Djangoâ€™s component-based architecture allows for easy scaling and flexibility.
